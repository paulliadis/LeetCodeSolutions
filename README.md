# LeetCodeSolutions

## About The Project
Hello! This is a repo of my solutions to [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. This code is currently all written in C# although I might do some Python as well. 
The purpose for me in doing these problems is to keep my skills sharp, learn some new techniques, and really review data structures used in programming. An added bonus
is that I find it quite fun to come up with these solutions.
